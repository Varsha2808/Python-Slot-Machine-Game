# Python-Slot-Machine-Game
This project is a text-based implementation of a simple slot machine game in Python. The game offers players a virtual slot machine experience, where they can deposit an initial amount, place bets on multiple lines, and spin the slot machine to potentially win or lose money based on the outcome.
